# Telegram bot repos

Just documenting down some of my telegram bot adventures!

## For info

Telegram is a cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed. 

It also provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for everyone to develop cool bots or games on its platform!


## Usage

Please have the following environments installed in your computer before running my codes:
- Python 3.7 (and above)
- Integrated Development Environment (preferably Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook add-on)

Run the following line before cloning the codes to ensure the libraries are installed:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace your bot's token in the code lines marked as "<YOUR TOKEN HERE>". 

To get a unique token for your very first Telegram bot, please do the following steps listed below:

1. Create a Telegram account (if you do not have one yet)
2. Go to [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and type in /newbot.
3. Follow the instructions listed by BotFather
4. Once you receive the confirmation message, copy and store the token in a safe and secure place.

Please read the respective README files in the folders to learn more about each respective functions of the bot.
